###Technologies in Web 2.0 and 3.0
- JavaScript, XML, JSON and AJAX.
- Web services interoperability
- Infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service capabilities, i.e., cloud computing.
- Mobile platforms and apps leading to ubiquitous computing
- Metadata, linked data and machine processing by intelligent agents


###Advantages
- Ubiquitous - all peoples use web browser
- Cross-Plataform
- Update and maintain web apps without distributing for all clients
- Cloud computing

###Disadvantages
- User experience not is very goob as desktop and pc apps
- Privacy and security
- For developer is difficult to develop and debug - multiple technology and languages
