Design Patterns

- Developing, maintaining and extending a complex web application is extremely difficult, but it using solid design principles can simplify each of tasks
- Softwares engineers use a abstraction to deal with this type of complexity
- Design patterns provide useful design abstractions for OPP

What is design pattern?

    - A design pattern is a description of interacting objects and classes that interact to solve a general design problem within a particular context
    - A design pattern is an abstract that can be applied over and over again
    - Design patterns provide a way to communicate the parts of a design

Server vs Client

    - Sever and Cliend have differents responsibilitys
    - The n-tier architeture is a highly useful design pattern that maps to the client-server model
    - This design patter on the conecpt of braking a system intpo differente pices or tiers
        - Each tier is responsible for providing a specific functionality

What are the advantages of such a design?
    - The abstraction provides a means for managing the complexity of the design
    - Tier can be upgraded or replaced independently as requirements or technology change
    - PROVIDES A BALANCE BETWEEN INNOVATION AD STANDARDIZATION
    - This system are much easier to build and maitaning
