# MVC Implementation in Rails

### Ruby on Rails

In Rails, the following classes support the MVC design pattern:

- Model – The ActiveRecord class, described previously, implements object-relational mappings (ORM).
- View – Views and controllers are actually bundled together in Rails in Action Pack. Dynamic content is generated by templates containing embedded Ruby (ERb) code supported by the ActionView class.
- Controller – The ActionController class is the core of a web request in Rails. It consists of one or more actions that are executed on request and then either render a template or redirect to another action. An action is defined as a public method on the controller, which will automatically be made accessible to the web-server through Rails Routes.

### MVC Interactions in Rails

1. The browser sends a request to the web server.
2. The web server process the request, determines wich route it belongs to and dispatches that request to the corresponding controller method
3. The controller asks the model layer for all of the information needed to complete the request
4. The model layer collects the requested information and return it to the controller
5. The controller gives the appropriate information to the view, requesting a particular format 
6. The view renders the information in that format and gives it back to the controller 
7. The controller assembles the total page is html and gives it to the web server 
8. The web server returns the page to the browser
