### HTML Document Structure

- The `DOCTYPE` declaration must be fist thing that appears in an HTML document
- This declaration is not an HTML tag, it lets the web browser know what version of HTML the page is write in
- For HTML the declaration is: `<!DOCTYPE html>`

```
<html>
    <head></head> - html head elments
    <body><body> - html body elements
</html>
```
- `<title>` is a required head element
- Other common head element is `<meta>` - used to provide metadata within an HTML document
- Every HTML body element is classified as being either a **block level** or **text-leve (inline)** element
- Block-level element define the major structure of a web page, e.g, headings, paragraphs, etc., and hey always produce a new line in the document
- Inline elements define the minor structure of web page, e.g., bold or emphasized text, and they do not produce a new line in the document
